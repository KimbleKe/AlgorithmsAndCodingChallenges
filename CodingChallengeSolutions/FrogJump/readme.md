Problem Statement
A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is initially located at position 0 and wants to reach position X. The frog always jumps a fixed distance D. Calculate the minimal number of jumps needed.

Input
X: Target position (integer, X ≥ 1)

D: Fixed jump distance (integer, D ≥ 1)

Output
Minimal number of jumps (integer)

Examples
X = 10, D = 3 → Output 4 (Jumps: 0→3→6→9→12)

X = 5, D = 1 → Output 5 (Jumps: 0→1→2→3→4->5)

X = 100, D = 5 → Output 20
