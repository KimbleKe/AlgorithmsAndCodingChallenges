Problem: DiscIntersections
Task Description:
Given an array A of N integers where each element A[i] represents the radius of a disc centered at (i, 0) on a 2D plane, compute the number of intersecting discs. If the number exceeds 10,000,000, return -1.

Examples:
A = [1, 5, 2, 1, 4, 0] → Returns 11

A = [1, 1, 1] → Returns 3

Constraints:
N is an integer within [0..100,000]

Each element in A is within [0..2,147,483,647]

Time: O(N log N)

Space: O(N)
