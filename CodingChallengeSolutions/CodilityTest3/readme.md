Problem:
A an array with of N, A has historical price of investment asset from last N days, goal is to compute the max income, if max income is too large, modulo 1000000000 so it returns the last 9 digits
e.g.
A=[4,1,2,3], result=6, sell at 4, buy at 1, sell at 3
A=[1,2,3,3,2,1,5], result=7, sell at 3, buy at 1, sell at 5
A=[1000000000,1,2,2,1000000000,1,1000000000],max income is 2999999998,but the result is 999999998 after modulo 1000000000
