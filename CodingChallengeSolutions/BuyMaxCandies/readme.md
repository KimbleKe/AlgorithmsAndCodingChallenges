Problem:

there are two candy shops, both of which have N candies for sale, 
first shop sells each candy for one golden coin, 2nd shop sells
each candy for one silver coin. you have n/2 golden coins and n/2
silver ones, n is even

each candy is of some particular type (not necessarily unique),
represented by an interger, what's the maximum number of different
types of candy that you can buy?

given 2 arrays A and B of n integers, representing types of candies in
the first and second shop respectively, returns the maximum possible
number of different types of candy you can buy

e.g.
A=[1,2,3,4], B=[3,3,3,7]
the function solution(A,B) return 4, you can buy candies of types 1,2
in the first shop and then candies of types 3,7 in the second shop

given
A=[2,2,2,2,2,2], B=[7,4,2,5,1,2]
the function returns 4, in the first shop you can only buy candies of type 2,
but then you can buy three candies of other types, e.g. 7,4,5 in second shop
