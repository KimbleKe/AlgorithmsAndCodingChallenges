Problem: CountDivisibles
Task Description:
Given three integers A, B, and K, return the count of numbers between A and B (inclusive) that are divisible by K.

Examples:
A = 6, B = 11, K = 2 → Returns 3 (divisibles: 6, 8, 10).

A = 0, B = 0, K = 1 → Returns 1 (0 is divisible by 1).

Constraints:
Time: O(1)

Space: O(1)
