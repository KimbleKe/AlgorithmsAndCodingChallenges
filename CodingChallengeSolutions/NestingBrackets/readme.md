Problem: NestingBrackets
Task Description:
Given a string S consisting solely of the characters '(' and ')', determine if it is properly nested (i.e., every opening bracket '(' has a corresponding closing bracket ')' in the correct order).

Examples:
S = "(()(())())" → Returns 1 (properly nested).

S = "())" → Returns 0 (not properly nested).

Constraints:
N (length of S) is within [0..1,000,000].

Time: O(N)

Space: O(1) (if optimized).
