Problem: MaxProfit
Task Description:
Given an array A of N integers representing stock prices on consecutive days, find the maximum possible profit from one transaction (buy once and sell once). Return 0 if no profit is possible.

Examples:
A = [23171, 21011, 21123, 21366, 21013, 21367] → Returns 356 (buy at 21011, sell at 21367).

A = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] → Returns 0 (prices only decrease).

Constraints:
N is within [0..400,000].

Each element in A is within [0..200,000].

Time: O(N)

Space: O(1)
