Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, find the smallest positive integer that does not appear in the array.

Examples
Input: [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2]
Output: 5 (Missing numbers: 5, 7, ... but 5 is the smallest missing positive integer.)

Input: [1, 2, 3]
Output: 4 (All 1,2,3 are present, so the next is 4.)

Input: [-1, -3]
Output: 1 (No positive integers in the array, so the smallest positive integer is 1.)
