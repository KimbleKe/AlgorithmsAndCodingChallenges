Problem: Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer

Problem Statement
Given a positive integer N, find the longest sequence of consecutive zeros in its binary representation that is surrounded by ones at both ends. Return the length of this longest gap.

Examples
Input: 9 (Binary: 1001)
Output: 2 (The longest zero sequence is "00")

Input: 529 (Binary: 1000010001)
Output: 4 (Two gaps exist: "0000" and "000", longest is "0000")

Input: 32 (Binary: 100000)
Output: 0 (No closing 1 after the zeros)
