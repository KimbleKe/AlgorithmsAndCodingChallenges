Problem Statement
Given an array A of integers, find the minimum absolute value of the sum of two elements (where the two elements can be the same).

Examples
Input: A = [1, 4, -3]
Output: 1 (Because |1 + (-3)| = 2 or |4 + (-3)| = 1 â†’ min is 1)

Input: A = [-8, 4, 5, -10, 3]
Output: 3 (Because |-8 + 5| = 3 is the smallest possible absolute sum)

Input: A = [0]
Output: 0 (Because 0 + 0 = 0)
