Problem Statement
Given a non-empty array A of N integers, find the minimal absolute difference between the sum of the first part and the sum of the second part when the array is split at any position P (where 1 ≤ P < N).

Examples
A = [3, 1, 2, 4, 3] → Output 1 (Split at P=3: left sum=6, right sum=7, difference=1)

A = [1, 1] → Output 0 (Perfect balance)

A = [-1000, 1000] → Output 2000 (Extreme values)
