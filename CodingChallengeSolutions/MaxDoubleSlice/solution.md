The logic behind using left and right maximum sums to find the MaxDoubleSlice result is based on cleverly decomposing the problem into two independent maximum subarray problems (similar to Kadane's algorithm) and then combining their results. Here's why this works:

### Core Insight:
A double slice (X, Y, Z) effectively splits the array into two parts:
1. Left part: From X+1 to Y-1 (maximum sum ending at Y-1)
2. Right part: From Y+1 to Z-1 (maximum sum starting at Y+1)

By finding the best possible left and right sums for every possible Y, we can determine the optimal double slice.

### Step-by-Step Logic:

1. **Left Maximum Array (left_max):**
   - Stores the maximum sum ending at each position when moving left-to-right
   - `left_max[i]` = max sum of subarrays ending at position i (not including A[Y])
   - Computed as: `max(0, left_max[i-1] + A[i])`
   - The `0` acts as a reset point (we can choose to start fresh)

2. **Right Maximum Array (right_max):**
   - Stores the maximum sum starting at each position when moving right-to-left
   - `right_max[i]` = max sum of subarrays starting at position i (not including A[Y])
   - Computed as: `max(0, right_max[i+1] + A[i])`

3. **Combining Results:**
   - For each potential Y (1 ≤ Y ≤ N-2):
     - The best left sum is `left_max[Y-1]` (max sum ending right before Y)
     - The best right sum is `right_max[Y+1]` (max sum starting right after Y)
     - Their sum represents the best double slice where Y is the middle point

### Why This Works:
- The `0` in `max(0, ...)` allows us to "skip" negative prefixes/suffixes
- By separating the problem into left and right passes, we break the O(N³) brute-force approach into O(N)
- The middle element Y is automatically excluded because:
  - Left sum goes up to Y-1
  - Right sum starts from Y+1

### Example Walkthrough:
For array A = [3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 5, -1, 2]

1. left_max = [0, 2, 8, 7, 11, 16, 15, 0]
2. right_max = [0, 16, 14, 8, 9, 5, 0, 0]
3. Checking at Y=3 (value -1):
   - left_max[2] = 8 (3+2+6 - includes A[1],A[2])
   - right_max[4] = 9 (4+5 - includes A[4],A[5])
   - Sum = 8 + 9 = 17 (the correct answer)

### Key Advantages:
1. **Optimal Substructure:** The best double slice must consist of the best left and right slices around some Y
2. **Overlapping Subproblems:** The left/right sums can be reused for different Y positions
3. **Efficiency:** Transforms an O(N³) problem into O(N) time with O(N) space

This approach elegantly handles all cases including:
- All negative numbers (returns 0 by skipping everything)
- Small arrays (directly returns 0 when N=3)
- Positive-heavy arrays (captures maximum possible sum)
