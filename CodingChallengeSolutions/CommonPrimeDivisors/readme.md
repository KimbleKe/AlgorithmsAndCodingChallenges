1. Problem Description
Given two arrays A and B of positive integers, determine for each pair (A[i], B[i]) whether they have exactly the same set of prime divisors.

2. Example Input/Output
Input:
A = [15, 10, 3]
B = [75, 30, 5]
Output: 1 (Only the pair (15,75) has identical prime divisors {3,5})

Edge Case (Empty Arrays):
Input: A = [], B = []
Output: 0

Edge Case (Primes):
Input: A = [7, 11], B = [7, 121]
Output: 1 (Only (7,7) matches)
