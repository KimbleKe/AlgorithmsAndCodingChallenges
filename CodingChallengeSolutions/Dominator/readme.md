Problem: Dominator
Task Description:
Given an array A of N integers, find any index of the dominator (a value that occurs in more than half of the elements). Return -1 if no dominator exists.

Examples:
A = [3, 4, 3, 2, 3, -1, 3, 3] → Returns 0, 2, 4, 6, or 7 (value 3 appears 5/8 times).

A = [1, 2, 3] → Returns -1 (no dominator).

Constraints:
N is within [0..100,000].

Each element in A is within [−2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].

Time: O(N)

Space: O(1)
