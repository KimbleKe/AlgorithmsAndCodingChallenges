1. Problem Description
Given two positive integers N (number of chocolates arranged in a circle) and M (step size), determine how many chocolates you will eat before encountering an empty wrapper. You start at position 0 and eat every M-th chocolate in a circular arrangement.

2. Example Input/Output
Input: N = 10, M = 4
Output: 5 (Sequence: 0, 4, 8, 2, 6)

Edge Case (M=1):
Input: N = 5, M = 1
Output: 5

Edge Case (N=M):
Input: N = 7, M = 7
Output: 1

Edge Case (Coprime):
Input: N = 9, M = 5
Output: 9
